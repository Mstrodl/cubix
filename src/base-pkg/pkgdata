# Base pkgdata for cubix

# As of actual packages, base is just a package with a special rule
# Because it can't get all files manually, Just made a rule that gets
# All files and folders in the given path, btw in base the path is /
# So it gets all items in / and put them in base.yap, simple.

pkgname=base
pkgver=0.5.3
# pkgbuild: (0.5.3-rc2) = 532
# pkgbuild: (0.5.4-rc2) = 542
# pkgbuild: (1.0.0-rc5) = 1005
pkgbuild=532
