Cubix Standards:

Rule #0:
    * Cubix Standards is a form of defining rules and standards to all programs in Cubix, so nothing can be broken following those.
    Reason: Just to be nice with devs out there

Rule #1:
    * No one should install(by yapi or similar) the base package after a sucessful install is made, never.(without user consent)
    Reason: reinstalling the base package means deleting all modifications in the code so far
            (I lost all of my work one time when I was testing yapi only because of that.)

Rule #2:
    * The YAP(Yet Another Package) format is defined at /src/yapi-extradocs/yap_fmt
    Reason: Unify all YAP information.
