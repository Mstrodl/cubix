Simple Boot Loader

The objective of SBL is to create a boot loader capable of load systems in their respective folders

By default SBL ships with 3 entries in systems.cfg:

Cubix;/boot/cubix
Cubix(minimal);/boot/cubix_minimal
CraftOS;/rom/programs/shell

It loads a Menu with there entries and when selected it loads the specified file in the entry.

Since SBL is a startup script, if the OS fails to load and sends control to SBL, it gives 5 seconds of debugging and then shutdowns the computer.
