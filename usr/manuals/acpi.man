ACPI Module

ACPI or Advanced Configuration and Power Interface is a interface for the OS to make power commands right away, without the direct interference on the hardware.

In CC, acpi works by making some cleanup tasks and killing processes before the CC (shutdown/reboot) kicks in

Suspend(acpi_suspend or os.suspend): acpi just suspends the computer until a key is presses

Hibernate(acpi_hibernate or os.hibernate): does not work now
