Cubix Shell

The Cubix Shell is located at /bin/cshell and referenced by /bin/sh.

When it starts it prints the user logged in that shell and the current directory, then it follows a simple rule, if the user is not root, it prints "$" after the shell, if it is, print "#"

By default the root user can run programs at /sbin and for a normal user to run it, it has to use "sudo" to do that
