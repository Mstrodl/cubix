On the subject of Time Servers

Time servers in cubix have to follow a simple syntax, when made a GET request to them, without any arguments, they need to return this:
{day,month,year,hours,minutes,seconds,}

getTime_fmt unserialises the data and it will get the current time, applying timezone calculations as it does so.
strtime(timezone1, timezone2) is the default method to get hours, minutes and seconds, all in a string
