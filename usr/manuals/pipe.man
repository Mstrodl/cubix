Pipes

A pipe is a communication interface between programs(not as well as unix, as unix links stdout of one program to stdin of another), the symbol used to create pipes(in cshell) is "|", a simple example would be:

ps | glep login

as a result, ps will show the list of processes, but glep filters that output, showing only the lines that contain "login", a example result would be:

2 /sbin/init > /sbin/login
