To developers wanting to create their own versions of base package:

Before "makeyap":
 * reboot into cubix(or craftos)
 * Clear /tmp/syslog(this is needed to clear boot messages)
  * rm /tmp/syslog && touch /tmp/syslog
 * remove UFSDATA(because of the long list of entries in UFSDATA, you need to do this)
  * rm /dev/hdd/UFSDATA

Running makeyap takes quite a long time getting all files in the system
and creating the yap file, it will be over 9000 lines long, so don't open it with
editors(atom uses a lot of ram when opening, gedit works ok)

After "makeyap":
 * sync the buffers(recreate UFSDATA with current configuration)
