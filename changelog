0.3.4 - 0.3.5 (10-31-2015)
  +Cubix is now MIT licensed
  +new (not new) security lock: when kernel is stable, "os.pullEvent = os.pullEventRaw" is applied
  +new: /sbin/modprobe
  +when loadmodule() loads a module that RELOADABLE = false is defined, it does not load the module
    This helps when trying to "modprobe proc /lib/proc_manager", since this would wipe os.processes,
    leaving no trace of init or other processes
  *bugfix: /bin/cshell does not run /sbin/, even if you provide the path
  +/bin/ls does not depend of os.runfile
  -os.runfile: DEPRECATED!
  +/bin/sudo uses permission module and front_login
  +os.system_halt does not use os.sleep(10000...) anymore
  !SBL: CraftOS does not boot anymore, still working on it
  +acpi uses permission now
  +acpi: acpi_suspend() works!
  +debug_write(message, screen) -> debug_write(message, screen, isError)
  +new: debug.warning(message)
  {disclaimer here: I used quite a lot of code from UberOS to create
  the filesystem manager to now, because of this, cubix is now MIT licensed}
  +fs_manager: permissions in unix format, load filesystems(for now its
  CFS, cubix file system, but there will be more), nodes and mounting devices :D
  +/sbin/kill: now can kill multiple PIDs!
  !sudo: because of magic, sudo still makes it way to os.processes, even
  if killed, so, don't trust him


0.3.3 - 0.3.4 (10-21-2015)
  +new loading mechanism for kernel, decreasing its size
  +login now uses sha256(password + salt) instead of sha256(password)
  +login: session tokens!
  +ACPI management now possible(SBL loads it by default)!
  +new: os.generateSalt
  *bugfix: /proc/cpuinfo & /proc/temperature now support stripping
  +new: /proc/partitions
  +new TTY logic

0.3.2 - 0.3.3 (10-13-2015)
  +new pipe logic using classes
  +starting fs_manager
  +/bin/tee now works!
  *bugfix: "while true do" in /bin/yes
  +/bin/cshell: now searches in path
  +/bin/sudo: now ignores if current user is root
  +/bin/init: runlevels (incomplete)
  +debug: kernel panic complete
  *fix: proc_manager: now the first PID is 1, not 2!
  +/bin/cpkg: Cubix Packages [wip]
  +reboot moved to /sbin

0.3.1 - 0.3.2 (10-10-2015)
  *bugfix: factor makes a infinite loop when n <= 0
  +/bin/cscript: CubixScript [going to create a manual]!
  +/bin/glep: grep in lua!
  +SBL: now you can load a kernel manually!
  +/bin/cubix
    +added boot options, for now its just "quiet" and "nodebug".
    +NEW os.pprint, stands for "pipe print"
  +/sbin/init
    +runlevels (still working)
  +/bin/cshell: FINALLY, PIPES! ("ps | glep login" works)

0.3.0 - 0.3.1 (10-07-2015)
  +/bin/cshell: now has a history
  +/bin/wget
  +/bin/cubix: NEW os.safestr, os.strsplit
    +about init: now init has some control about how the system will load (just loads /sbin/login, but its a thing!)
  +/dev/random: not using os.time(), using os.clock() instead!
  +procmanager: calls to debug are being written to os.debug

0.2.1 - 0.3.0 (10-05-2015)
  -bugfix in cp, rn, mv, mkdir, touch (including the draft nano)... (string comparison, "s[1] == 'a'" does not work)
  -consistency fix on cat: opening a file and not closing it after use
  -cp: does not require absolute paths now!
  -su and sulogin: using os.runfile() now
  -cleanup: not using /bin/shell and /bin/wshell anymore!
  -/dev/MAKEDEV now creates /usr
  -login manager: add users and change password of a user

0.1.0a - 0.2.1 (by 09-30-2015)
  -proc_manager now can kill processes, including their children!
    -every program has to have its main(args) function defined!, it's a rule.
    -proc_manager runs this function when the process of a file is created and run(using os.run_process)
  -Manuals!, use man to run, following the syntax:
    -man <topic> <manual>
      -follows to /usr/manuals/topic/manual.man
    -man <manual>
      -follows to /usr/manuals/manual.man
